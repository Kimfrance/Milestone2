# Hotel Website README

This repository contains the code for a hotel website. The website is designed to showcase the hotel's features, provide information about the rooms and services, and allow users to book a room.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-website.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd hotel-website`
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the website.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure and content of the website. It consists of the following sections:

- **Header**: Contains the navigation menu and the hotel logo.
- **Main Content**: Divided into several sections, including a featured image, a section about the hotel's style, a section about the unique rooms, and sections for services and contact information.
- **Footer**: Contains navigation links and social media icons.

## CSS Styling

The website's styles are defined in the `style.css` file. It contains various CSS rules that customize the appearance and layout of the website. The CSS file is linked to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

## JavaScript Functionality

The `script.js` file includes JavaScript functions that handle room booking. It provides a `bookRoom` function that prompts the user for their details and performs a simplified booking logic. The `getRoomDetails` function is a placeholder that can be replaced with actual logic to fetch room details from a database or API.
